# Learning Apache Beam

I'm following the learning resources here in order to better understand Apache Beam and, more generally, Dataflow: https://beam.apache.org/documentation/resources/learning-resources/

I'll be using this repo to capture the local installation process so that I can easily boot up an environment.

## Requirements

To take full advantage of the development environment:

* make
* pyenv
  * Install python 3.7.9 with `pyenv install 3.7.9`

## Environment

To create the environment, run

```shell
make venv
```

## WordCount Examples
